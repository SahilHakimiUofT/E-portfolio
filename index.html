        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p class="description">I am proficient with the basics such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          I also have experience with MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and Node.js through developing a functioning React Web App. I have also recently gained experience with the .NET framework while mainly working on front end components of Web applications UI, as well as unit testing. </p>

        <h3>Unity Game Development</h3>
        <p class="description">While working for StemPowering I was required to build a Unity game and integrate it into an Angular website
          to keep kids engaged on an educational platform. With 1 other team member we started learning Unity game development and C# through internet tutorials
          and started planning out our game. We settled on a 2D platformer that would have STEM themes such as Biology, Electricity, Magnetism, etc.
          To work efficently we both worked on seperate aspects of the game, my focus was on creating scripts for player mechanics, managing enemies,
          combat system, collectibles, saving progress, updating score, checkpoints, player health, and a respawn system. I also worked on animating assets within
          Unity that another team member developed.
          Currently we have developed a fully functional 2D Platformer game with over 20+ levels and STEM based themes using the Unity Engine along with
          C# game scripts. We have also integrated the websites API endpoints within the game to save progress and update player score
          on a global leaderboard that all users can see. This game is still in progress but so far it has kept kids entertained and engaged on our website!</p>

        <h3>.NET Web Development</h3>
        <p class="description">While working for Taq Auto I am part of the Credit Driver Team.
          This team works on the Credit Driver Application for TAQ which is where clients can fill out 
          lease applications for vehicles and track the status of the application as well as have values 
          for their lease calculated for them. Initially I had to learn the .NET framework and familiarize myself with it as that is what the application is built with along with the rest of TAQ's software that I have been introduced to so far. Once I got a basic understanding of 
          this framework I then started essentially shadowing other team members with their tasks. The first project I worked on when shadowing was the rebranding of SCI Marketview to TAQ. This rebrand required visual UI changed all accross the application that I also worked on. The next project I worked on was introducing Dealer Rate Buy Down to the lease applications and this required both front end UI changes as well as changes in the backend that had to do with the calculations for the application. The most recent project that I just finished working on was adding the new Federal Luxury Tax to the platform and my work in this was mainly in the front end UI. The Credit Driver is constantly needing updates and new changes to it so that is still what I am working on currently with the team.

        <h3>Vinfast and Lucid integration</h3>
        <p class="description">One of the biggest projects for Taq for 2021/2022 comes with their recent partnerships with Lucid and Vinfast. Lucid and Vinfast are two up and coming exciting electric vehicle manufacturers. These partnerships come with a lot of work for Taq to integrate them into out software. I continued to work with the CreditDriver team so we also had some work to do for the integration of Lucid and Vinfast. On my end the majority of my tasks for this project had to do with updating the database tables as well as uploading the new document templates for lucid/vinfast credit applications. To update the database tables I had to write new SQL scripts that inserted data for all the new document templates as well as some of the data for the new vehicles that we would be allowing our users to fill out lease applications for. For the document uploads I also had to work on Adobe Acrobat as well as XML mapping files to ensure that the information a user filled into the online credit application would then map and fill in correctly to the appropriate documents so that the user could then print them out.
