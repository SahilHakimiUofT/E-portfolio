        <h3>Unity Game Development</h3>
        <p class="description">While working for StemPowering I was required to build a Unity game and integrate it into an Angular website
          to keep kids engaged on an educational platform. With 1 other team member we started learning Unity game development and C# through internet tutorials
          and started planning out our game. We settled on a 2D platformer that would have STEM themes such as Biology, Electricity, Magnetism, etc.
          To work efficently we both worked on seperate aspects of the game, my focus was on creating scripts for player mechanics, managing enemies,
          combat system, collectibles, saving progress, updating score, checkpoints, player health, and a respawn system. I also worked on animating assets within
          Unity that another team member developed.
          Currently we have developed a fully functional 2D Platform with over 20+ levels and STEM based themes using the Unity Engine along with
          C# game scripts. We have also integrated the websites API endpoints within the game to save progress and update player score
          on a global leaderboard that all users can see. This game is still in progress but so far it has kept kids entertained and engaged on our website!</p>
